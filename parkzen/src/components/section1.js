        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
          At Bodyrock Body, we specialize in seriously fun and effective
          back-to-basics core fitness training. At the center of our program is
          the belief that before you attempt to master heavy weights or
          expensive machines, you must first master your body.
        </p>
        <p>We're old school...</p>
        <p>
          If you were to ask a big-name gym franchise about what we do every
          day, they'd probably ask "why are they still doing those same
          old-school workouts that our dads did? Our answer is "because it
          works."
